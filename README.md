Building AngryNinjas
====================

To build AngryNinjas, create a directory where you will want to build
the source code, and checkout cocos2d-xna and MonoGame, side by side
AngryNinjas.  You can use the following command in your shell to do
so:


	git clone git://github.com/mono/cocos2d-xna.git 
	git clone git://github.com/mono/MonoGame.git 
	git clone git://github.com/xamarin/AngryNinjas 

The MonoGame [projects must be generated](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame#solutions--projects), which you can easily do by executing the following commands:

	cd MonoGame
	mono Protobuild.exe

Then open the solution for the platform that you want to target.
Currently there are solutions for: Android, MacOS X, Ouya, iOS,
Windows, Windows Phone and XNA.
